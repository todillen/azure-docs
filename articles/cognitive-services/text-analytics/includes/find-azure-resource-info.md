> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the resource you created to find your key and endpoint. They'll be located on the resource's **Quick start** page, under **resource management**.
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview).
