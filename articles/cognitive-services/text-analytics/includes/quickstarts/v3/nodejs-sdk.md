[Reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-js-textanalytics-ref-docs) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-text-analytics) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples)

> [!NOTE]
> * This quickstart uses version `3.0-preview` of the Text Analytics client library, which includes a public preview for improved [Sentiment Analysis](../../../how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis.md#sentiment-analysis-versions-and-features) and [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](../../../how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking.md#named-entity-recognition-versions-and-features).
>
> * The code in this article uses un-secured credentials storage for simplicity reasons. For production scenarios, we recommend sending strings in batches for performance and scalability. For example, calling `SentimentBatchAsync()` instead of `Sentiment()`.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-resource-creation](../resource-creation.md)]

### Create a new Node.js application

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run this version of the Text Analytics client library [in your browser](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/documentation/Bundling.md).

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```
### Install the client library

Install the `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` NPM packages:

```console
npm install --save @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

Create a file named `index.js` and add the following libraries:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, CognitiveServicesCredential } = require("@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics");
```

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../../find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
const key = '<paste-your-text-analytics-key-here>';
const endpoint = `<paste-your-text-analytics-endpoint-here>`;
```

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a `TextAnalyticsClient` object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch.

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Code examples

* [Client Authentication](#client-authentication)
* [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis) (public preview)
* [Language detection](#language-detection)
* [Named Entity recognition](#named-entity-recognition-public-preview) (public preview)
* [Named Entity recognition - personal information](#named-entity-recognition---personal-information-public-preview) (public preview)
* [Entity linking](#entity-linking)
* [Key phrase extraction](#key-phrase-extraction)

## Client Authentication

Create a new `TextAnalyticsClient` object with your key and endpoint as parameters.

```javascript
const client = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint,  new CognitiveServicesCredential(key));
```

## Sentiment analysis (public preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The below code is for sentiment analysis v3, which is in public preview.

Create an array of strings containing the document you want to analyze. Call the client's `analyzeSentiment()` method and get the returned `SentimentBatchResult` object. Iterate through the list of results, and print each document's ID, document level sentiment with confidence scores. For each document, result contains sentence level sentiment along with offsets, length, and confidence scores.

```javascript
async function sentimentAnalysis(client){

    const sentimentInput = [
        "I had the best day of my life. I wish you were there with me."
    ]

    const sentimentResult = await client.analyzeSentiment(sentimentInput);
    result.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`ID: ${document.id}`);
        console.log(`\tDocument Sentiment: ${document.sentiment}`);
        console.log(`\tDocument Scores:`);
        console.log(`\t\tPositive: ${document.documentScores.positive.toFixed(2)} \tNegative: ${document.documentScores.negative.toFixed(2)} \tNeutral: ${document.documentScores.neutral.toFixed(2)}`);
        console.log(`\tSentences Sentiment(${document.sentences.length}):`);
        document.sentences.forEach(sentence => {
            console.log(`\t\tSentence sentiment: ${sentence.sentiment}`)
            console.log(`\t\tSentences Scores:`);
            console.log(`\t\tPositive: ${sentence.sentenceScores.positive.toFixed(2)} \tNegative: ${sentence.sentenceScores.negative.toFixed(2)} \tNeutral: ${sentence.sentenceScores.neutral.toFixed(2)}`);
            console.log(`\t\tLength: ${sentence.length}, Offset: ${sentence.offset}`);
        })
    });
}
sentimentAnalysis(textAnalyticsClient)
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
ID: 0
        Document Sentiment: positive
        Document Scores:
                Positive: 0.61  Negative: 0.01  Neutral: 0.39
        Sentences Sentiment(2):
                Sentence sentiment: positive
                Sentences Scores:
                Positive: 1.00  Negative: 0.00  Neutral: 0.00
                Length: 30, Offset: 0
                Sentence sentiment: neutral
                Sentences Scores:
                Positive: 0.21  Negative: 0.02  Neutral: 0.77
                Length: 30, Offset: 31
```

## Language detection

Create an array of strings containing the document you want to analyze. Call the client's `detectLanguages()` method and get the returned `DetectLanguageResult`. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, with respective primary and detected language.

```javascript
async function languageDetection(client) {

    const languageInputArray = [
        "Ce document est rédigé en Français."
    ]

    const languageResult = await client.detectLanguages(languageInputArray);

    result.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.detectedLanguages.forEach(language =>
        console.log(`\tDetected Language ${language.name}`)
        );
        console.log(`\tPrimary Language ${document.primaryLanguage.name}`)
    });
}
languageDetection(textAnalyticsClient);
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
ID: 0
        Detected Language French
        Primary Language French
```

## Named Entity Recognition

> [!NOTE]
> The below code is for Named Entity Recognition v3, which is in public preview.

Create an array of strings containing the document you want to analyze. Call the client's `recognizeEntities()` method and get the `RecognizeEntitiesResult` object. Iterate through the list of results, and print the entity name, type, subtype, offset, length, and score.

```javascript
async function entityRecognition(client){

    const entityInputs = [
        "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800",
        "La sede principal de Microsoft se encuentra en la ciudad de Redmond, a 21 kilómetros de Seattle."
    ];

    const entityResults = await client.recognizeEntities(entityInputs);

    entityResults.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.entities.forEach(entity => {
            console.log(`\tName: ${entity.text} \tType: ${entity.type} \tSub Type: ${entity.subtype != "" ? entity.subtype : "N/A"}`);
            console.log(`\tOffset: ${entity.offset}, Length: ${entity.length} \tScore: ${entity.score}`);
        });
    });
}
entityRecognition(textAnalyticsClient);
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console

```

## Named Entity Recognition - personal information (public preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The below code is for detecting personal information using Named Entity Recognition v3, which is in public preview.

Create an array of strings containing the document you want to analyze. Call the client's `recognizePiiEntities()` method and get the `EntitiesBatchResult` object. Iterate through the list of results, and print the entity name, type, subtype, offset, length, and score.


```javascript
async function entityPiiRecognition(client){

    const entityPiiInput = [
        "Insurance policy for SSN on file 123-12-1234 is here by approved."
    ]
    const entityResults = await client.recognizePiiEntities(entityPiiInput);

    result.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.entities.forEach(entity => {
            console.log(`\tName: ${entity.text} \tType: ${entity.type} \tSub Type: ${entity.subtype != "" ? entity.subtype : "N/A"}`);
            console.log(`\tOffset: ${entity.offset}, Length: ${entity.length} \tScore: ${entity.score}`);
        });
    });
}
entityPiiRecognition(textAnalyticsClient);

        Offset: 33, Length: 11  Score: 0.85
```

## Entity Linking

Create an array of strings containing the document you want to analyze. Call the client's `recognizeLinkedEntities()` method and get the `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesResult` object. Iterate through the list of results, and print the entity name, ID, data source, url, and matches. Every object in `matches` array will contain offset, length, and score for that match.

```javascript
async function linkedEntityRecognition(client){

    const linkedEntityInput = [
        "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."
    ]
    const entityResults = await client.recognizeLinkedEntities(linkedEntityInput);

    entityResults.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.entities.forEach(entity => {
            console.log(`\tName: ${entity.name} \tID: ${entity.id} \tURL: ${entity.url} \tData Source: ${entity.dataSource}`);
            console.log(`\tMatches:`)
            entity.matches.forEach(match => {
                console.log(`\t\tText: ${match.text}`);
                console.log(`\t\tOffset: ${match.offset}, Length: ${match.length} \tScore: ${match.score.toFixed(3)}`);
            })
        });
    });
}
linkedEntityRecognition(textAnalyticsClient);
```
