# Threat detection for data services in Azure Security Center

 Azure Security Center analyzes the logs of data storage services, and triggers alerts when it detects a threat to your data resources. This article lists the alerts that Security Center generates for the following services:

* [Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse](#data-sql)
* [Azure Storage](#azure-storage)
* [Azure Cosmos DB](#cosmos-db)

## SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse <a name="data-sql"></a>

Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.

You'll see alerts when there are suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, or SQL injection attacks, as well as anomalous database access and query patterns.

Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database and SQL is part of the [Advanced Data Security (ADS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities, covering Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL Database managed instances, Azure SQL Data Warehouse databases, and SQL servers on Azure Virtual Machines.

For more information, see:

* [How to enable Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-overview)
* [How to enable Advanced Threat Protection for SQL servers on Azure Virtual Machines](security-center-iaas-advanced-data.md)
* [The list of threat protection alerts for SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse](alerts-reference.md#alerts-sql-db-and-warehouse)

## Azure Storage <a name="azure-storage"></a>

Advanced Threat Protection for Storage (currently available for Blob storage only) detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without requiring you to be a security expert, and helps you manage your security monitoring systems.

>[!NOTE]
>Advanced Threat Protection for Storage is currently not available in Azure government and sovereign cloud regions.

For more information, see:

* [How to enable Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-advanced-threat-protection)
* [The list of threat protection alerts for Azure Storage](alerts-reference.md#alerts-azurestorage)

## Azure Cosmos DB<a name="cosmos-db"></a>

The Azure Cosmos DB alerts are generated by unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Azure Cosmos DB accounts.

For more information, see:

* [Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Cosmos DB (Preview)](../cosmos-db/cosmos-db-advanced-threat-protection.md)
* [The list of threat protection alerts for Azure Cosmos DB (Preview)](alerts-reference.md#alerts-azurecosmos)
