#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to know how to write a web API that calls web APIs by using the Microsoft identity platform for developers.

# A web API that calls web APIs: Call an API

After you have a token, you can call a protected web API. You do this from the controller of your ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core web API.

## Controller code

The following code continues the example code that's shown in [A web API that calls web APIs: Acquire a token for the app](scenario-web-api-call-api-acquire-token.md). The code is called in the actions of the API controllers. It calls a downstream API named *todolist*.

After you've acquired the token, use it as a bearer token to call the downstream API.

```csharp
private async Task GetTodoList(bool isAppStarting)
{
 ...
 //
 // Get an access token to call the To Do service.
 //
 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 try
 {
  app = BuildConfidentialClient(HttpContext, HttpContext.User);
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(Scopes, account)
                     .ExecuteAsync()
                     .ConfigureAwait(false);
 }
...

// After the token has been returned by Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), add it to the HTTP authorization header before making the call to access the To Do list service.
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);

// Call the To Do list service.
HttpResponseMessage response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(TodoListBaseAddress + "/api/todolist");
...
}
```
